Information & Requirements
--------------------------

It’s my first Django-Projekt. You may use the code and templates for 
educational purposes or your own projects.

[Python Image Library (PIL)](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ "Python Imaging Library (PIL)") is required.

This site uses the Subversion-Trunk at *Django 1.0 Final*.

Installation
------------

This project has sample data. To install do:

    python manage.py syncdb

This creates all database tables in an SQLite database and dumps some data in
the tables. It also creates a superuser:

* **User**: test
* **Password**: test

Syncdb will ask if you would like to create a superuser, choose (no) as the
fixture will create a superuser.

Language for the site is german, if you would like to have an english
interface change `LANGUAGE_CODE = 'de-de'` to `LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'`
in settings.py. To start the server do:

    python manage.py runserver

This starts the development server on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

You can visit the website in your browser. To log into the admin interface
point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and log in with the test user.
